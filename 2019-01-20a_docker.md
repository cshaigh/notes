# Docker and Containers: The Big Picture

* Up-front capex
* On-going opex

## Containers and Modern Stateless Apps

"Hypervisors revolutionised IT"

Pros:
* Let us keep our existing apps
* Simple migrations
* Made life easy

Cons:
* We've still got our legacy apps!

We *could* deploy *some* of our legacy apps directly inside of containers but it's not as simple as with VMs and it kinda misses the point

Containers are great at modern cloud-native apps

Develops apps that are: -
* modern
* scalable
* self-healing
* portable

Pros:
* The Way Forward

Cons:
* Takes pain and effort to get there

## Containers and Traditional Apps

* containers naturally excel for modern cloud-native apps
* can also be used for traditional enterprise apps

Docker containers are persistent by nature
* stopping doesn't wipe its data
* restarting brings its data back
* container data stored in volumes persists

Containers do a great job with stateful and stateless applications

# Docker Hub and Other Container Registries

**Container registries are becoming central to application infrastructure and application delivery**

* Registry: overall service
* Repository: project within service
* Can control privacy and security

## Private Registries
* run inside corporate network
* Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)
* e.g. Quay Enterprise
* Docker Content Trust

Automated container build process
1. Write / tweak / modify app
2. Push to software repo
3. Run tests
4. Push to Container Registry - performs automated build
5. Deployment
6. Hosting

# Are Docker and Containers Ready for Production and the Enterprise?
* Production worthiness and enterprise worthiness are **your** decision

## Offerings from Docker Inc.
* Docker Engine
* Docker Swarm - native Docker clustering
* Docker Content Trust - verify content and publisher

### Docker Engine Channels
1. Experimental - nightly, bleedging edge
2. Stable - every ~2 months
3. Commercially Supported - every ~6 months; stable configs; paid support contract

# Container Orchestration
* Apps comprise multiple parts
* Defines our app
* Provisions infrastructure
* Deploys our app
* Scales our app

Docker
* Docker Machine - provisions docker hosts/engines
* Docker Compose - compose multi-container apps
* Docker Swarm - schedule containers over multiple docker engines

Ecosystem orchestration products
* Kubernetes
* Mesosphere DCOS - used by Azure Container Registry
* CoreOS fleet, etcd
* OpenStack Magnum
